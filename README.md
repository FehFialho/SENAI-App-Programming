*In Progress at SENAI*  

**Course:** Technical Course in Systems Development  
**Subject:** Application Programming  
**Instructor:** Nicolas Marques  

This repository contains lessons, exercises, and projects developed throughout the course, covering **web programming fundamentals** such as **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, alongside a focus on **React**. The materials were designed to build foundational skills in web development and enable the creation of dynamic, component-based user interfaces using React’s core concepts like JSX, state management, and component lifecycle.  

### Running React Projects  
To run the React applications, you need to have **Node.js** and **npm** (or **yarn**) installed on your system.  

Install dependencies and start the development server with the following commands:

```bash
npm install
npm start
